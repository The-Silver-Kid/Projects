PLAYERNAME: Ok...?

            My kingdom was at the peak of its time, even the other kingdoms looked up to us in awe.

PLAYERNAME: Keep going! I want to know!

            One day there was a war, because we began to take land from the others and they wanted it back. We were defeted but they had mercy on us because we were soo great they sent us to the Skylands and destroyed the portal.

PLAYERNAME: Skylands? Where are they I would like to visit!

            You were just there PLAYERNAME

PLAYERNAME: The end?

            Now it is known as that.

PLAYERNAME: Why what happened?

            Well We were having enormous growth in the Skylands, untill the Dark one attacked. He had grown jellous of us and wanted to rule.

PLAYERNAME: Who was he?

            He was the rightfull heir to the thrown before my son was born.

PLAYERNAME: I never knew my parents...

            You will meat them when the time is right.

PLAYERNAME: Continue your story.

            The Dark one Created a giant dragon and named it after me. And sent it down to the normal world and it killed everyone, then it came back for us. The dark one wanted the Skylands for himself and with the dragons help all the Skylands were destroyed and the survivors were turned evil and given powers of teleportation.

PLAYERNAME: The Endermen.

            Exactly. Only three people excaped, The Skylands Changed into Endstone and lost forever. 

PLAYERNAME: So, What happened next?

            Me my wife and my son hid in the depest pits of the nether and only whence the time was right would we leave.

PLAYERNAME: And now is right?

            No. 

PLAYERNAME: Im confused

            Let me finish then.

PLAYERNAME: Ok...

            After a time the Dark one Dyed leaving the dragon behind. This confused the dragon because he was told he would never die unless killed by the rightfull son of the king.

PLAYERNAME: But I killed it...

            I know... Um, it was a lie told to the dragon.

PLAYERNAME: But if only you your wife and your son escaped you must be one of my relitives.

            Yes me and my wife await your help.

PLAYERNAME: What about your son?

            This is not the time to talk of him.

PLAYERNAME: What is your problem?

            The Wither.

PLAYERNAME: How do I find it and kill it?

            It can only be found by collecting the skulls of three wither skeletons. placing these on soul sand simmalar to a Iron Golem that the villagers have, it will force the wither to you.

PLAYERNAME: I will try my best.

            Once you have killed the Wither make a beacon with the Soul of the Wither and some glass and Obsidian.

PLAYERNAME: Then what?

            Make a piramid of Iron, diamond, lapis, or gold, or any combination of it and place the becon on top. Once you unlock Regeneration you will have freed us and me and my wife will restore the Skylands, with your help when we need it.

PLAYERNAME: If I get back to the normal world I will do this.

            Yes.

PLAYERNAME: Can you do that?

            I have just enought straingth to do that.

PLAYERNAME: I am ready.

            Go my son and free us!
